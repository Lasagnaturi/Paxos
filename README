Every script can be run as default.

Run every file named run_xxx.sh from you terminal
example: ./run.sh paxos size

P.s. at the end of every run bash file there is a sleep call setted to 50 seconds, according to the size of the problem it might not be enough.
If the execution result truncated just increase it.
